# Switch to the specified commit
git checkout <SHA code>		 

# Switch back to get to present
git checkout main			      

# Creates a new commit that undoes the changes introduced by the specified commit.
git revert <SHA code>

# To undo a git revert
git revert <SHA-of-the-revert-commit>     

-----

# To recover git reset
git add .

# Safer, checks that no one else has pushed changes to the remote branch since your last pull
git push --force-with-lease               

# Use git revert for shared branches (e.g., main) to avoid disrupting history.
# Use git reset for local branches or when youâ€™re sure no one else relies on the branch, as it rewrites history.

############################# Pulling Changes from the Repository  

# 1. Pull changes from the remote repository, rebasing any local commits on top of the updated code  
git pull --rebase  

# 2. If you encounter a merge conflict during the rebase process, abort the rebase.  
# This will return your branch to the state before the rebase was initiated.  
git rebase --abort  

# 3. Alternatively, if rebasing is not your preferred method or you want to incorporate changes without rebasing.
git pull



############################# git pull vs git pull --rebase

# If Your Local Branch is Up to Date or Has No Conflicts: 
# If you haven't made any changes to your local branch since you last pulled
git pull --rebase

# If You Have Uncommitted Changes or Want Merge Context:
# If your local branch has changes or you want to see a clear merge history
git pull




############################# Creating, Rebasing, and Syncing a Feature Branch in Git

# 1. Create a new branch for your feature or changes  
git checkout -b my-feature-branch  

# 2. Staging and committing changes 
git add .  
git commit -m "Describe your changes here"  

# 3. Fetch the latest changes from the upstream repository  
git fetch upstream  

# 4. Rebase your current branch on top of the latest changes from upstream/main  
git rebase upstream/main  

# 5. If you encounter conflicts during the rebase process, stage the resolved files  
git add <file-with-conflicts>  

# 6. Continue the rebase process after resolving conflicts  
git rebase --continue  

# 7. Push the rebased changes to your forked repository, forcing the update  
git push origin my-feature-branch --force  

# 8. Switch back to the main branch  
git checkout main  

# 9. Fetching and merging changes into your local main branch
git fetch upstream  
git merge upstream/main  

# 10. Push the updated main branch to your forked repository
