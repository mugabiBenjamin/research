## npm vs yarn vs pnpm

| npm Command               | Yarn Command                    | pnpm Command                    |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `npm install <package>`   | `yarn add <package>`            | `pnpm add <package>`            |
| `npm uninstall <package>` | `yarn remove <package>`         | `pnpm remove <package>`         |
| `npm install`             | `yarn install` (or just `yarn`) | `pnpm install` (or just `pnpm`) |
| `npm update`              | `yarn upgrade`                  | `pnpm update`                   |
| `npm list`                | `yarn list`                     | `pnpm list`                     |
| **`npm run dev`**         | **`yarn dev`**                  | **`pnpm dev`**                  |
| `npm start`               | `yarn start`                    | `pnpm start`                    |
| `npm run build`           | `yarn build`                    | `pnpm build`                    |
| `npm init`                | `yarn init`                     | `pnpm init`                     |
| `npm update <package>`    | `yarn upgrade <package>`        | `pnpm update <package>`         |
| `package-lock.json`       | `yarn.lock`                     | `pnpm-lock.yaml`                |

### yarn installation

```bash
npm install -g yarn  # Install yarn globally
npm update -g yarn  # Update yarn globally
```

### Key Differences

- **Lock Files**: `npm` uses `package-lock.json` to lock down the versions of a package's dependencies, while `yarn` uses `yarn.lock`.
- **Speed**: Yarn generally performs installations faster than npm because it caches every package it downloads.
- **Workspaces**: Yarn supports workspaces to manage monorepos, which can simplify the management of multiple packages in a single repository.

### Key pnpm features worth noting

- pnpm uses a content-addressable storage system, making it faster and more disk-space efficient
- The lockfile format is YAML instead of JSON
- All commands follow npm's syntax more closely than Yarn does
- You can also use `pnpm i` as a shorthand for `pnpm install`

### pnpm installation

```bash
npm install -g pnpm  # Install pnpm globally
npm update -g pnpm  # Update pnpm globally
```

## Cloning a repo that uses uv

- **Step 1: Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
```

- **Step 2: Install dependencies from pyproject.toml**

```bash
# Install uv if not already installed
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Create virtual environment and install dependencies
uv sync

# Or if you want to specify Python version
uv sync --python 3.11
```

- **Step 3: Activate virtual environment (optional)**

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Or use uv run for commands (no activation needed)
uv run python main.py
```

- **Step 4: Run the FastAPI application**

```bash
# Using uv run (recommended - no venv activation needed)
uv run uvicorn main:app --reload

# Or if venv is activated
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## Migrating from `requirements.txt` to `uv`

- **Step 1: Initialize uv project**

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd your-project

# Initialize uv project (creates pyproject.toml)
uv init

# Or if you want to specify Python version
uv init --python 3.11
```

- **Step 2: Convert requirements.txt to pyproject.toml**

```bash
# Add dependencies from requirements.txt
uv add fastapi uvicorn

# Or add all at once if you have a requirements.txt
uv add -r requirements.txt
```

- **Step 3: Create virtual environment and install dependencies**

```bash
# Create and activate virtual environment
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
uv sync
```

- **Step 4: Run your FastAPI application**

```bash

# Using uv run (recommended)
uv run uvicorn main:app --reload

# Or traditional way after activating venv
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

## When to use each `sync`

### `uv sync`

- Fresh project setup from existing pyproject.toml
- Installing only production dependencies
- CI/CD pipelines, Docker builds

### `uv sync --extra dev`

- Development environment setup
- Installs main + dev dependencies (testing, linting tools)
- When pyproject.toml has [project.optional-dependencies] sections

### `uv add --editable .`

- Making your project code importable during development
- Want changes to reflect immediately without reinstalling
- Building a package/library you're actively developing
