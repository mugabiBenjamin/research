## npm vs Yarn Command Comparison

| npm Command               | Yarn Command                    |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `npm install <package>`   | `yarn add <package>`            |
| `npm uninstall <package>` | `yarn remove <package>`         |
| `npm install`             | `yarn install` (or just `yarn`) |
| `npm update`              | `yarn upgrade`                  |
| `npm list`                | `yarn list`                     |
| `npm run <script-name>`   | `yarn <script-name>`            |
| `npm init`                | `yarn init`                     |
| `npm update <package>`    | `yarn upgrade <package>`        |
| `package-lock.json`       | `yarn.lock`                     |

### Yarn Installation

```bash
npm install -g yarn  # Install Yarn globally
```

### Key Differences

- **Lock Files**: `npm` uses `package-lock.json` to lock down the versions of a package's dependencies, while `yarn` uses `yarn.lock`.
- **Speed**: Yarn generally performs installations faster than npm because it caches every package it downloads.
- **Workspaces**: Yarn supports workspaces to manage monorepos, which can simplify the management of multiple packages in a single repository.
