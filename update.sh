# Enhanced Ubuntu System Update Script
# 
# This script performs a comprehensive system update and maintenance routine
# with robust error handling, memory management, security checks, and detailed logging.
#
# Instructions:
# 1. Save this file as "update.sh"
# 2. Make it executable: chmod +x update.sh
# 3. Run with sudo privileges: sudo ./update.sh

# Set error handling options
set -o pipefail
set -o errtrace  # Enable error tracing for functions

# Define colors for better output readability

# End of the script

# In this bash script, just recommend changes, improvements, enhancements and modifications that can be implemented, having in consideration graceful handling of potential errors, clearing redundant memory (cache, dentries, inodes and temporary files), log rotation by deleting old logs, security enhancements like Checking for and applying security updates, functionality improvements, conflict prevention. Add comments to explain what each part of the script does, Idempotency: Ensure that running the script multiple times produces the same result (where applicable). For example, running the update command twice shouldn't cause issues. And in the long run, the script should not  compromise the system. Also the script should not abstract any steps and process. It should show every step it is currently on running in the terminal with its respective progress
